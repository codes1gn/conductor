# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Conductor PyTorch Backend Integration enables seamless execution of PyTorch models on custom 'gcu' hardware through the Conductor compiler. This system provides a drop-in replacement for existing PyTorch backends while maintaining full compatibility with the torch.compile API and offering intelligent optimization through operation fusion and buffer management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Registration and Integration

**User Story:** As a PyTorch developer, I want to register the 'gcu' backend automatically when importing the conductor package, so that I can use it immediately with torch.compile without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conductor package is imported THEN the system SHALL automatically register the 'gcu' backend with PyTorch's compilation system
2. WHEN torch.compile is called with backend='gcu' THEN the system SHALL accept the compilation request without errors
3. WHEN the backend registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the cause and potential solutions
4. WHEN PyTorch version compatibility issues exist THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle version mismatches with informative warnings

### Requirement 2: JIT Mode Compilation Pipeline

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want to compile PyTorch models dynamically using JIT mode, so that I can develop and test models iteratively without pre-compilation steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PyTorch model is compiled with backend='gcu' in JIT mode THEN the system SHALL convert the FX Graph to Conductor DSL format
2. WHEN DSL generation is complete THEN the system SHALL invoke the Conductor CLI compiler to generate executable artifacts
3. WHEN compilation succeeds THEN the system SHALL load the compiled artifacts and enable execution on GCU hardware
4. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and fallback to the Inductor backend
5. WHEN the same model is compiled multiple times THEN the system SHALL cache compilation results to improve performance

### Requirement 3: AOT Mode Artifact Loading

**User Story:** As a production engineer, I want to load precompiled artifacts in AOT mode, so that I can deploy models with minimal startup overhead and predictable performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PyTorch model is compiled with backend='gcu' in AOT mode THEN the system SHALL locate and load precompiled artifacts (.so or .o files)
2. WHEN precompiled artifacts are found THEN the system SHALL integrate them with PyTorch's execution engine
3. WHEN precompiled artifacts are missing or incompatible THEN the system SHALL fallback to JIT compilation or Inductor backend
4. WHEN artifact loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and attempt graceful recovery

### Requirement 4: Operation Fusion Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to automatically fuse compatible operations, so that I can achieve optimal performance without manual optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing an FX Graph containing consecutive elementwise operations THEN the system SHALL identify fusion opportunities
2. WHEN elementwise operations are followed by reduction operations THEN the system SHALL create fusion clusters combining both operation types
3. WHEN fusion clusters are created THEN the system SHALL generate optimized DSL code that minimizes kernel launches
4. WHEN operations cannot be safely fused THEN the system SHALL process them individually without performance degradation
5. WHEN fusion heuristics are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain mathematical correctness of the original computation

### Requirement 5: Buffer Management and Memory Optimization

**User Story:** As a systems engineer, I want intelligent buffer management with appropriate scoping, so that memory usage is optimized and data flow is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating Conductor DSL THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate buffer scopes (local, shared, global) based on usage patterns
2. WHEN temporary variables are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically manage their lifecycle and prevent naming conflicts
3. WHEN buffers are shared between operations THEN the system SHALL ensure proper data dependencies and synchronization
4. WHEN memory optimization opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL reuse buffers where mathematically safe
5. WHEN buffer allocation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and attempt recovery strategies

### Requirement 6: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a PyTorch user, I want robust fallback mechanisms when operations are unsupported, so that my existing code continues to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unsupported operation is encountered in the FX Graph THEN the system SHALL fallback to the Inductor backend without user intervention
2. WHEN compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information and attempt fallback compilation
3. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle exceptions and provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN fallback mechanisms are triggered THEN the system SHALL log the reason for fallback to aid in debugging and optimization

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can validate correctness and performance of the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL validate individual component functionality with high code coverage
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL verify end-to-end JIT and AOT pipeline functionality
3. WHEN validating DSL generation THEN the system SHALL use FileCheck to ensure correctness of generated code
4. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL benchmark against baseline implementations and detect regressions
5. WHEN testing fusion logic THEN the system SHALL verify mathematical correctness of fused operations

### Requirement 8: Package Distribution and Installation

**User Story:** As a user, I want simple installation and minimal dependencies, so that I can quickly integrate the conductor backend into my existing PyTorch workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the package THEN the system SHALL support standard pip installation from PyPI
2. WHEN resolving dependencies THEN the system SHALL require only essential dependencies (PyTorch 2.0+, Python 3.8+)
3. WHEN installing on different platforms THEN the system SHALL support Linux, macOS, and Windows with consistent behavior
4. WHEN optional C++ extensions are available THEN the system SHALL build them automatically but gracefully handle build failures
5. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL be immediately usable without additional configuration steps

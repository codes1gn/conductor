"""
Naming Strategies and Validation.

This module provides systematic naming strategies for DSL generation:
- NamingStrategy: Protocol for different naming approaches
- SystematicNamingStrategy: Consistent, predictable naming
- LegacyNamingStrategy: Backward compatibility with existing names
- NameValidator: Validation of generated names

Naming strategies ensure consistent, readable, and valid identifiers
throughout the generated DSL code.
